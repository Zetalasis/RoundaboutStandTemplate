# Roundabout Stand Addon Template
## About
A template for creating a stand addon for the mod [Roundabout](https://github.com/Hydraheads/RoundaboutMod/).

## Getting Started
This code is kind-of complex. Most of the instructions will be copied over from the [Multiloader Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template/tree/1.20.1) that this repo is designed around, but there are quite a few specific ones.
After setting this up to personalize it, i.e. changing the mod author, mod id, and whatnot. See if you can run Minecraft, If not, try to debug it.
Assuming you can run Minecraft, you should be free to start looking through the code. It's quite a bit messy, but I've designed it to be *mostly* common-sided.<br><br>


Code comments have been dotted around explaining what things do.
